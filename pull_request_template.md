<!-- Before creating a pull request to submit a new or modified definition or language file, be certain you have tested your file(s) in game and that they work correctly! -->

<!-- All definitions must use the namespace for the mod they are for, and only for a single mod. eg minecraft.conf is for vanilla minecraft. pixelmon.conf is for pixelmon. Verify a mods namespace with it's in-game items and blocks etc -->

<!-- All definitions submitted must follow the same basic layout of GriefDefender's minecraft.conf with USER and ADMIN groups only -->
<!-- Custom grouping can be done by server owners in the manner they choose, and it is easier if everyone is provided with a standard layout to start with -->

<!-- Increment the version string in your definitions file when submitting a change -->
<!-- Version strings are only to be Major.Minor, increment Major only for major changes made to definitions, additions and corrections are minor changes -->

<!-- No comments are to be present in definitions, only definitions and version string -->
